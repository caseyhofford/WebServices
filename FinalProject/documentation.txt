Troubleshooting:
Make sure your VM is set to use port forwarding on 127.0.0.2:8000

DNS errors occur when you have changed networks while leaving your VM open. Please try restarting your VM

If you are experiencing issues with accessing the google api server please disable ipv6 and try again. This can be done by adding the following lines to the specified file.
/etc/modprobe.d/aliases
replace:
  alias net-pf-10 ipv6
with:
  alias net-pf-10 off
  alias ipv6 off
then reboot
