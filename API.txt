Warehouse Server App API

General Formatting
hierarchical URL: /<category>/<product>
Query Strings: place ? at the end of the hierarchical URL followed by the desired parameters, relevant parameters for each method are listed under the method heading below. Irrelevant parameters will be ignored.
General Errors:
"path too long" - there are too many "/" to the hierarchical portion of the URL
"specified method <method> is not valid" - you used a HTTP method other than GET, PUT, POST or DELETE, these are the only valid methods for this API


Displaying stock
Use HTTP GET
Hierarchical URL is used to specify desired resource
the base URL will return the entire stock
/<category>/<product> will return the quantity of the product
/<category> will return all products with quantities inside the specified category
Errors:
"database is empty" - there is no file 'database' on the server, or the file is empty
"category not found" - the specified category does not exist in the database file
"item not found" - the specified item was not found in the selected category


Restocking/Selling items (increment and decrement):
Use HTTP POST
a category and item must be specified in the hierarchical path e.g. /animals/giraffe
parameters:
option=<increment OR decrement> (required)
quant=<int> (defaults to 0)
Errors:
"item does not exist" - the chosen item does not exist or you only specified a category, no item
"negative quantity error" - occurs when a decrement operation would leave a stock below zero, does not change the stock of this product
"invalid option, choose increment or decrement" - the option parameter must be set to either 'increment' or 'decrement'
"plese include the option parameter in your query string and a path to an item, not a category" - the option parameter was excluded in your URL, this parameter is required for a POST or the path was too short


Adding products:
Use HTTP PUT
A new category and product can be specified here. If an existing category with a new product is specified the product will be added to this category without effecting the previous entries. If there is an exact match of product and category, the old product will be overwritten with the new quantity.
Specify the desired product and category using the hierarchical URL e.g. /animals/giraffe
parameters:
quant=<int> to specify stock. New quantities default to 0
Errors:
"category exists" - when adding a category without an item this will be displayed if the specified category already exists in the database file.
"specify category and item" - occurs when both category and item are empty, this is a meaningless operation, you can not create a new root directory


Deleting products:
Use HTTP DELETE
Hierarchical URL is used to specify which resource will be deleted
/<category>/<product> will delete the specified item
/<category> will delete the specified category
/ deleting root is not allowed
Errors:
"item does not exist" - the specified item does not exist within the specified category, no changes were made
"category does not exist" - the specified category does not exist in the database, no changes were made
"deleting the entire database is not allowed" - no category or item specified, this is not a legal operation
